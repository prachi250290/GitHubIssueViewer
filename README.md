Libraries used in Project:
-Retrofit 
-Gson
-RecyclerView
-Picasso

Minimum SDK version  - 15 (It will be supported on devices with version 4.0.3 and above)

Development IDE :
-Android Studio 2.1.1

Notes:
1. I have used RecyclerView over ListView because of its performance benefits over ListView
2. The request has a limit of fetching 30 records. Hence I have used pagination and load the next items as the user scrolls.
